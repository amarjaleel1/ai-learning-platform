# Bug Fixes Status Report

## Original Issues (Fixed)

### HTML File Issues
1. ✅ Missing script import - `additional_lessons.js` is now properly imported
2. ✅ Icon class error - Changed invalid Font Awesome icon class
3. ✅ Missing functions - Added `prepareVisualization()` function
4. ✅ Inconsistent lesson structure - Code editor visibility now conditional

### JavaScript Issues
1. ✅ Integration of additional lessons - `addAdditionalLessons()` is now called
2. ✅ User state management - Added `saveUserState()` function
3. ✅ Potential race condition - Proper loading sequence implemented
4. ✅ Missing error handling - Added try/catch blocks and validation

## Newly Discovered Issues

1. ✅ **Duplicate visualization code**:
   - Problem: `prepareVisualization` function was defined twice in `visualization.js`
   - Fix: Removed the duplicate function definition at the end of the file

2. ✅ **Missing getCurrentLesson function**:
   - Problem: Function was called but not defined anywhere
   - Fix: Implemented in `lessons.js` to return the current lesson object

3. ✅ **Missing updateVisualizationWithResult function**:
   - Problem: Function was called but not defined in `visualization.js`
   - Fix: Implemented function to update visualizations based on code execution results

4. ✅ **Inconsistent user state initialization**:
   - Problem: `userState` object was referenced without proper initialization
   - Fix: Added initialization code in `profile.js` with default values and localStorage persistence

5. ✅ **Event handler registered multiple times**:
   - Problem: Event listeners were attached multiple times to the same buttons
   - Fix: Implemented a `setupEventHandlers()` function that replaces elements to remove old listeners

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Accessibility improvements**:
   - Add ARIA attributes for better screen reader support
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for text and background colors

2. **Responsive design**:
   - Make sure the platform works well on mobile devices

3. **Code organization**:
   - Consider using ES6 modules instead of multiple script tags

4. **Performance optimization**:
   - Lazy load resources that aren't needed immediately
