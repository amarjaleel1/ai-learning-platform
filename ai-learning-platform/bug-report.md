# Bug Report: AI Learning Platform

## Newly Discovered Issues

1. **Duplicate visualization code**:
   - In `visualization.js`, the `prepareVisualization` function is defined twice - once near the start and once at the end
   - **Fix**: Remove the duplicate function definition at the end of the file

2. **Missing getCurrentLesson function**:
   - In `code-editor.js`, there's a call to `getCurrentLesson()` in the hint button handler, but this function isn't defined
   - **Fix**: Implement the function in `lessons.js` to return the current lesson object

3. **Missing updateVisualizationWithResult function**:
   - In `code-editor.js`, line 209 calls `updateVisualizationWithResult(result)` but this function isn't defined
   - **Fix**: Implement this function in `visualization.js`

4. **Inconsistent user state initialization**:
   - The `userState` object is referenced in multiple files but there's no clear initialization
   - **Fix**: Create proper initialization code in `profile.js` with default values

5. **Event handler registered multiple times**:
   - The "run-code" button has event listeners attached in both `code-editor.js` and potentially elsewhere
   - **Fix**: Ensure event handlers are registered only once

## Remaining Issues from Previous Report

### General Recommendations

1. **Accessibility improvements**:
   - Add ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for text and background colors.

2. **Responsive design**:
   - Make sure the platform works well on mobile devices with appropriate breakpoints.

3. **Code organization**:
   - Consider modularizing the code further for better maintainability.
   - Use ES6 modules instead of multiple script tags.

4. **Performance optimization**:
   - Lazy load resources that aren't needed immediately.
   - Consider implementing code splitting for faster initial load times.
