# Bug Report: AI Learning Platform

## HTML File Issues (`index.html`)

1. **Missing script import**:
   - The `additional_lessons.js` file exists but is not imported in the HTML file. This means those additional lessons won't be loaded.
   - **Fix**: Add `<script src="lessons/additional_lessons.js"></script>` before `lessons.js`

2. **Icon class error**:
   - Line 83: `<i class="fas fa-chart-network"></i>` uses an invalid Font Awesome icon class.
   - **Fix**: Change to a valid icon like `<i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i>` or `<i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i>`

3. **Missing functions**:
   - `prepareVisualization()` is called in `lessons.js` but there's no indication it's defined in any of the imported scripts.
   - **Fix**: Ensure this function is defined in `visualization.js`

4. **Inconsistent lesson structure**:
   - The code editor is shown for all lessons but some lessons might not require coding.
   - **Fix**: Add conditional logic to show/hide the code container based on lesson type.

## JavaScript Issues

1. **Integration of additional lessons**:
   - `addAdditionalLessons()` from `additional_lessons.js` is never called in `lessons.js`.
   - **Fix**: Import and call this function in `lessons.js`

2. **User state management**:
   - `saveUserState()` is called but not defined in the visible code.
   - **Fix**: Ensure this function is defined, likely in `main.js` or `profile.js`

3. **Potential race condition**:
   - Lessons are initialized before user state might be fully loaded.
   - **Fix**: Ensure user state is loaded before initializing lessons.

4. **Missing error handling**:
   - No error handling for code execution or validation.
   - **Fix**: Add try/catch blocks around code execution and validation logic.

## General Recommendations

1. **Accessibility improvements**:
   - Add ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for text and background colors.

2. **Responsive design**:
   - Make sure the platform works well on mobile devices with appropriate breakpoints.

3. **Code organization**:
   - Consider modularizing the code further for better maintainability.
   - Use ES6 modules instead of multiple script tags.

4. **Security considerations**:
   - Add input validation for user-submitted code.
   - Consider using a sandboxed environment for code execution.

5. **Performance optimization**:
   - Lazy load resources that aren't needed immediately.
   - Consider implementing code splitting for faster initial load times.
